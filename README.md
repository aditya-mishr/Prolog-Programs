# Prolog-Programs
Write a program in C/C++ /Prolog to do the following.
1. Check whether a given propositional expression is valid or consistent or inconsistent
using semantic tableau method. Develop the following predicates/modules and call them
appropriately.
a. Read an expression
b. Functions for each semantic rule.
c. Display all closed and open paths of the Semantic Tableau tree along with each line
having display of the rule applied and the expression on which it is applied.

2. Convert a given propositional expression P into set of clauses and develop interpreter to
show that a query Q is Logical Consequence of P by using resolution refutation method.
